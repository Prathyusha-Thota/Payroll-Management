# Payroll Management System

## Overview
The Payroll Management System is a modular and responsive application designed to automate salary processing and employee records. It ensures scalability and resilience using AWS and Chaos Engineering principles.

- ## Features
- Employee management (add, update, delete employees)
- Payroll processing (salary calculation, tax deductions)
- User authentication and role-based access
- Reports generation for payroll data
- Scalable and resilient infrastructure using AWS
- Chaos Engineering implementation using AWS and Terraform

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Cloud Services:** AWS
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
- **Chaos Engineering:** AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/payroll-management.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd payroll-management
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   ```sh
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Deployment
- Deploy the application using AWS services such as EC2, S3, and Lambda.
- Use Terraform scripts to automate infrastructure provisioning.
- Implement Chaos Engineering tests with AWS FIS to ensure system resilience.
